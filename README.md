UFC Data Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a detailed analysis of UFC data through interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboards. Starting with cleaning dirty data using Power Query, I generated key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX functions and calculated fields to provide deep insights into various aspects of UFC fights, fighters, and events.

Dashboards Overview

	1.	UFC Fight Stat Dashboard
	•	Comprehensive analysis of individual fights.
	•	Key metrics include fight outcomes, total strikes, significant strikes, and takedowns.
